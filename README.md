This is the first version of **Blackline** (v1).  
It is **no longer maintained** and **will not** work, and most likely will not build either.

## Overview

Blackline originally served as a **learning project** during my journey exploring:

- C++  
- Rust  
- React  
- Windows API  

It contains:  

- An **unfinished UI**  
- A **bootstrapper** (non-functional)  
- A **module**  
- An **injector**

## References & Credits

Parts of this project are derived from or inspired by the work of others:  

- Injector forked from [Deni210's Roblox MMapper](https://github.com/Deni210/Roblox-MMap-Injector)  
- Module heavily based on [Deni210's Module Source](https://github.com/Deni210/Module-Source)  

For further learning and exploration, you may also find these projects useful:
